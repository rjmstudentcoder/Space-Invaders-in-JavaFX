# Description

On March 15th, I did not know how to navigate the Eclipse IDE. I could not manage project files, I did not know how to debug a Java program, and I certainly did not know how to use JavaFX.
On March 17th, in an attempt to learn these tools, I began recreating space invaders using JavaFX and Eclipse.

# Skills Learned
I think it's worth noting what I learned during this exercise.

- How to create a Java desktop app in Eclipse.
- How to create Java Classes and Interfaces.
- Importing Java packages into Eclipse.
- How to debug Java build errors.
- How to handle Graphics and Input in JavaFX.
- How to use GitHub Desktop alongside Eclipse.
- How .gitignore works.
- How to load file resources in Java.

I found that planning out a project beforehand is important. I had initially written many lines of code with the expectation that I would use them. Over the past few days, however, I found much more efficient or intuitive methods to use. 
Because I worked on the project without a plan, I wrote code I didn't need, and as a result, lost time.
